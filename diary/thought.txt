- Powerinput of sensor boards
  - 5V (not lower then 4.75V)
    - Not stable
  - 12V supply 
    - Regulate with LM7805
    - How to supply?
    - boards can be too rot, effect on the temperature measurement
    
- Handle with I2C
  - Using microprocessor to convert I2C to ZAC protocol, which allows RS485 communication
